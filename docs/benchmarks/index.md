title: The OpenMessaging Benchmark Framework
---

The OpenMessaging Benchmark Framework is a suite of tools that make it easy to benchmark distributed messaging systems in the cloud.

## Project goals

The goal of the OpenMessaging Benchmark Framework is to provide benchmarking suites for an ever-expanding variety of messaging platforms. These suites are intended to be:

* **Cloud based** &mdash; All benchmarks are run on cloud infrastructure, not on your laptop
* **Easy to use** &mdash; Just a few CLI commands gets you from zero to completed benchmarks
* **Transparent** &mdash; All benchmarking code is open source, with pull requests very welcome
* **Realistic** &mdash; Benchmarks should be largely oriented toward standard use cases rather than bizarre edge cases

> If you're interested in contributing to the OpenMessaging Benchmark Framework, you can find the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/openmessaging/benchmark).

## Supported messaging systems

OpenMessaging benchmarking suites are currently available for the following systems:

* [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org)
* [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.incubator.apache.org)

> Benchmarking suites for [Apache RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) will be available soon.

For each platform, the benchmarking suite includes easy-to-use scripts for deploying that platform on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) and then running benchmarks upon deployment. For end-to-end instructions, see platform-specific docs for:

* [Apache Kafka](/docs/benchmarks/kafka)
* [Apache Pulsar](/docs/benchmarks/pulsar)

## Benchmarking workloads

Benchmarking workloads are specified in [YAML](http://yaml.org/) configuration files that are available in the [`workloads`](workloads) directory. The table below describes each workload in terms of the following parameters:

* The number of topics
* The size of the messages being produced and consumed
* The number of subscriptions per topic
* The number of producers per topic
* The rate at which producers produce messages (per second). **Note**: a value of 0 means that messages are produced as quickly as possible, with no rate limiting.
* The size of the consumer's backlog (in gigabytes)
* The total duration of the test (in minutes)

Workload | Topics | Partitions per topic | Message size | Subscriptions per topic | Producers per topic | Producer rate (per second) | Consumer backlog size (GB) | Test duration (minutes)

## Interpreting the results

Initially, you should see a log message like this, which affirms that a warm-up phase is intiating:

```
22:03:19.125 [main] INFO - ----- Starting warm-up traffic ------
```

You should then see some just a handful of readings, followed by an aggregation message that looks like this:

```
22:04:19.329 [main] INFO - ----- Aggregated Pub Latency (ms) avg:  2.1 - 50%:  1.7 - 95%:  3.0 - 99%: 11.8 - 99.9%: 45.4 - 99.99%: 52.6 - Max: 55.4
```

At this point, the benchmarking traffic will begin. You'll start see readings like this emitted every few seconds:

```
22:03:29.199 [main] INFO - Pub rate 50175.1 msg/s /  4.8 Mb/s | Cons rate 50175.2 msg/s /  4.8 Mb/s | Backlog:  0.0 K | Pub Latency (ms) avg:  3.5 - 50%:  1.9 - 99%: 39.8 - 99.9%: 52.3 - Max: 55.4
```

The table below breaks down the information presented in the benchmarking log messages (all figures are for the most recent 10-second time window):

Measure | Meaning | Units
:-------|:--------|:-----
`Pub rate` | The rate at which messages are published to the topic | Messages per second / Megabytes per second
`Cons rate` | The rate at which messages are consumed from the topic | Messages per second / Megabytes per second
`Backlog` | The number of messages in the messaging system's backlog | Number of messages (in thousands)
`Pub latency (ms) avg` | The publish latency within the time range | Milliseconds (average, 50th percentile, 99th percentile, and 99.9th percentile, and maximum)

At the end of each [workload](#benchmarking-workloads), you'll see a log message that aggregages the results:

```
22:19:20.577 [main] INFO - ----- Aggregated Pub Latency (ms) avg:  1.8 - 50%:  1.7 - 95%:  2.8 - 99%:  3.0 - 99.9%:  8.0 - 99.99%: 17.1 - Max: 58.9
```

You'll also see a message like this that tells into which JSON file the benchmarking results have been saved (all JSON results are saved to the `/opt/benchmark` directory):

```
22:19:20.592 [main] INFO - Writing test result into 1-topic-1-partition-100b-Kafka-2018-01-29-22-19-20.json
```

> The process explained above will repeat *for each [benchmarking workload](#benchmarking-workloads)* that you run.

## Adding a new platform

In order to add a new platform for benchmarking, you need to provide the following:

* A [Terraform](https://terraform.io) configuration for creating the necessary AWS resources ([example](https://github.com/streamlio/messaging-benchmark/blob/lperkins/readme-changes/driver-kafka/deploy/provision-kafka-aws.tf))
* An [Ansible playbook](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks.html) for installing and starting the platform on AWS ([example](https://github.com/streamlio/messaging-benchmark/blob/lperkins/readme-changes/driver-pulsar/deploy/deploy.yaml))
* An implementation of the Java [`driver-api`](https://github.com/streamlio/messaging-benchmark/tree/master/driver-api) library ([example](https://github.com/streamlio/messaging-benchmark/tree/lperkins/readme-changes/driver-kafka/src/main/java/io/openmessaging/benchmark/driver/kafka))
* A YAML configuration file that provides any necessary client configuration info ([example](https://github.com/streamlio/messaging-benchmark/blob/master/driver-pulsar/pulsar.yaml))
